# Overview

The file `default.nix` contains a complete build description that works with the [Nix package manager](https://nixos.org/guides/install-nix.html).

## General advice
If you like, setup.sh can give you a general idea of how to build euforia, but it might be out of sync with the nix build.

# Run EUForia

    ./bin/euforia <vmt-file>

You can find some examples in `./examples`.
